## Mass Extinctions Module

_Are we experiencing the sixth great extinction?_  

What is the current pace of vetebrates extinction rates? Is it accelerating? How does it compare to background extinction rates? How do we account for NA values in the data?

## Background

- [Section Intro Video](https://youtu.be/QsH6ytm89GI)
- [Ceballos et al (2015)](http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1400253)

Our focal task will be to reproduce the result from Ceballos and colleagues showing the recent increase in extinction rates relative to the background rate, as well as looking at different results of extinction rates from including and excluding NA values.

### Data about the species:

Here we use RESTful API to read in data about all species evaluated by the IUCN Red List.
```{r}
species_ap <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/species"
page <- "/page/"
page_number <- 0:10
query <- "?token="
token <- "9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"

#write a function to get http, clue everything together to make a url that iterates over the vector of page_number
all_pages <- paste0(species_ap, page, page_number, query, token)
```

We will get the results for all 10 pages, each has 10,000 records of all species published. 
```{r all_results, cache = TRUE}
#apply map to all_pages a vector
all_results <- map(all_pages, GET)
```

Let's look at the names of the data.
```{r}
row <- all_results[[1]] %>% content() %>% getElement("result") %>% getElement(1)
names(row)
```

Using the names we got above, here we turn the data into "rectangular" dataframe. According to the paper by Ceballos on species extinctions, both extinct species and extinct in the wild species were selected to make their final graph. To reproduce their result, we are filtering to have only species under these two categories. 
```{r}
row_to_tibble <- function(row){
  tibble(scientific_name = row$scientific_name, 
         category = row$category, 
         phylum = row$phylum_name,
         class = row$class_name)
}

get_result <- function(x){
  x %>% content() %>% getElement("result") %>% 
  map_dfr(row_to_tibble)
}
```
```{r all_species_EX_EW,cache=TRUE}
all_species <- all_results  %>% map_dfr(get_result) %>% filter(category=="EX"| category=="EW")
all_species
```

We can see that 989 species went extinct or extinct in the wild. Let's see the unique phylums of those species. For the purpose of reproducibility, we will select only the species of Chordata phylum because they are vertebrates.
```{r}
unique(all_species$phylum)
```

### Data about the species extinction dates:

Lets get the extinction dates for these species. The data is store in the narrative text for each species. Again, we are setting up the urls to be called in the RESTful API.
```{r}
all_extinct <- all_species %>% pull(scientific_name)

base <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org"
narrative <- "/api/v3/species/narrative/"
name_group1 <- all_extinct
query <- "?token="
token <- "9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"
url <- paste0(base, narrative, name_group1, query, token)
```

We have already called the urls for all the extinct species (this will take awhile) and saved it as an R object RDS. The code chunk below will load the object if the file exists or it will download the data if the file doesn't exist. Then this object consists narratives of all extinct and extinct in the wild species is read into all_data.
```{r}
if (!file.exists("massive_resp.rds")){
  resp <- map(url, GET)
  saveRDS(resp, "massive_resp.rds")
} else {
  all_data <- readRDS("massive_resp.rds")
}
```

We will need to get the rationale section for each species in order to find out what dates they went extinct. 
Here are the narratives of the species, the narratives that are NULL are stored as NA.
```{r cache=TRUE}
map_chr_na <- possibly(map_chr, as.character(NA))

narrative <- all_data %>% map(content) %>% map("result") %>% 
  map(map_chr_na, "rationale")
```

Lets extract the extinction date for species that have dates in their narrative. We created a custom function to extract any 4 digit number from the rationales. We then unlist them as they are nested in lists.
```{r}
extinc_year <- map(narrative, function(x){
  str_extract_all(x, "\\d{4}") %>% 
  unlist()
}) 
```

We will bin the years for all species into the specific bins for our final graph. Since we are using bins of an 100-year interval. It is reasonable to put them in these bins. 
For rationales of species that contain more than one year, if the years are within the 100-year interval, we will collapse them into the same bin. If they are not within the 100-year interval however, we will select the latest year and put it in the corresponding bin. We chose to do so because we observed that the narratives have a tendency to list the last seen date as the date of approximate extinction.
Lastly, if there is no narrative, or Null values, we will give them NA as values. 
```{r}
bin_year <- function(x) {
  x = as.integer(x)
    case_when(
      between(x, 1500, 1600) ~ "1600",
      between(x, 1600, 1700) ~ "1700",
      between(x, 1700, 1800) ~ "1800",
      between(x, 1800, 1900) ~ "1900",
      between(x, 1900, 2020) ~ "2000",
      !between(x, 1500, 2020) ~ as.character("not a year"),
      length(x) < 1 ~ as.character(NA)) %>%
      unique() %>%
      max()
}
```

Here we apply our binning function to all the years that we extracted from the species rationale to come up an extinction date for each species.
It is important to note that we assigned all null narratives which were replaced to NAs by our binning function earlier to have 1600 as its values. This is because we will calculate the cumulative sum for each group of species, the cumulative sum would start at the beginning and continue to the latest year bin, which means that all the species of null dates will get counted from the beginning of our time series and continued to be counted to the end. This would be our maximum possible species that have gone extinct. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
all_year <- 
  extinc_year %>% 
  map(possibly(bin_year, NA_real_)) %>%
  as.integer() %>% 
  replace_na(1600)
```

Here we are adding the extinction dates (including dates of NA values that are binned into 1600) for 989 species calculated above to our table of 989 species consists of EX - Extinct and EW - Extinct in the Wild species.
```{r}
all_species_with_year <- all_species %>%
  mutate(extinct_year = all_year)
all_species_with_year
```

To reproduce a similar result to Ceballos's final graph, we did the following -
We sorted the species with extinction dates into 4 different groups: Mammals, Birds, Vertebrates and Other Vertebrates. 
We included Mammals, Birds and Amphibians in the Vertebrates group. For the Other Vertebrates group, we excluded Mammals and Birds and included all species in the Chordata phylum, which includes all other vertebrates. 
```{r}
verte <- c("MAMMALIA","AVES","AMPHIBIA")

birds <- all_species_with_year %>% 
  filter(class == "AVES") %>% mutate(group = "Birds")

mammals <- all_species_with_year %>% 
  filter(class == "MAMMALIA") %>% mutate(group = "Mammals")

vertebrate <- all_species_with_year %>% 
  filter(class %in% verte) %>% mutate(group = "Vertebrates")

all_others <- all_species_with_year %>% 
  filter(phylum == "CHORDATA") %>% 
  filter(!class %in% c("MAMMALIA", "AVES")) %>% 
  mutate(group = "Other Vertebrates")
```

Here, we calculate the cumulative sums for each group and create a new table with all groups combined. 
```{r}
count_sum <- function(table) {
  new_table <- table %>%
  group_by(extinct_year, group)%>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(cum_sum = cumsum(count))
  return(new_table)
}

birds_sum <- count_sum(birds)
mam_sum <- count_sum(mammals)
vert_sum <- count_sum(vertebrate)
other_sum <- count_sum(all_others)

all_types <- rbind(birds_sum, mam_sum, vert_sum, other_sum)
all_types
```

Now, we also need to get the total of all species (with and without being classified as extinct or extinct in the wild) for each group, this will be our denominator for the cumulative percentage calculation at the end.
```{r all_species_evaluated, cache = TRUE}
all_species_eval <-all_results  %>% map_dfr(get_result)
```

```{r}
birds_total  <- birds <- all_species_eval %>% 
  filter(class == "AVES") %>% mutate(group = "Birds")

mammal_total <- mammals <- all_species_eval %>% 
  filter(class == "MAMMALIA") %>% mutate(group = "Mammals")

vert_total <- vertebrate <- all_species_eval %>% 
  filter(class %in% verte) %>% mutate(group = "Vertebrates")

other_total <- all_others <- all_species_eval %>% 
  filter(phylum == "CHORDATA") %>% 
  filter(!class %in% c("MAMMALIA", "AVES")) %>% 
  mutate(group = "Other Vertebrates")
  
```

In order to arrive at the fractions of cumulative extinctions as percentages of IUCN-evaluated species, we need to divide the total of a species of each group in each bin to the total number of that species.
To get each group total count, we made a new table to have only total counts for 4 groups (birds, mammals, vertebrate, other vertebrates). 
We joined this table to our current master extict table to create another more comprehensive table where the total counts and species counts per bin year, so that we can derive the cumulative percentages. 
```{r}
group_total <- data.frame(group = 
                                  c("Birds", "Mammals", "Vertebrates", "Other Vertebrates"),                                    
                          sum_species = 
                                  c(nrow(birds_total), nrow(mammal_total),                                                      nrow(vert_total),nrow(other_total)))

master_ex_table <- all_types %>%
  left_join(group_total) %>%
  mutate(perc_ex_withNA = 100*(cum_sum/ sum_species))
master_ex_table
```

Lets' visualize these maximum possible extinction rates that we calculated by including NA dates in the year bin of 1600.
```{r}
master_ex_table %>% ggplot(aes(x = factor(extinct_year), group = group, color = group)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = perc_ex_withNA), lwd = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Vertebrate Species as EX or EW by the IUCN 2019",
       y = 'Cumulative extinctions as % of UCN-evaluated species',
       x = "Time interval") + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("1500-1600", "1600-1700", "1700-1800", "1800-1900", "1900-2000")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,2, by=0.2)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10))
    
```

Comparing to the Fig. 1 graph in Ceballos's paper, we see that the graph was made using IUCN data as of 2012. It has been almost 8 years since then. We therefore suspect that our graph is reflecting the changes in the extinction rates. Particularly, we see an elevated rate of extinction for the vertebrates group.
However, we can only say that this result shows the maximum possible veterbrate extinctions with N.A values for extinction dates accounted for.
Now, We want to reproduce the data without the NA values to see the difference.
```{r warning = FALSE}
all_year_noNA <- 
  extinc_year %>% 
  map(possibly(bin_year, NA_real_)) %>%
  as.integer()

all_species_noNA <- all_species %>%
  mutate(extinct_year = all_year_noNA) %>%
  drop_na()
all_species_noNA

```

Our table without the rows of NA values for extinct year now has only 548 species. This number is only around 58% of all extinct species. 
Lets' similarly filter this no NA dataframe for the same vertebrate groups of species that we are interested in. 
```{r}
birds_noNa <- all_species_noNA %>% 
  filter(class == "AVES") %>% mutate(group = "Birds")

mammals_noNa <- all_species_noNA %>% 
  filter(class == "MAMMALIA") %>% mutate(group = "Mammals")

vertebrate_noNa <- all_species_noNA %>% 
  filter(class %in% verte) %>% mutate(group = "Vertebrates")

all_others_noNa <- all_species_noNA %>% 
  filter(phylum == "CHORDATA") %>% 
  filter(!class %in% c("MAMMALIA", "AVES")) %>% 
  mutate(group = "Other Vertebrates")
```

We calculate the cumulative sums for each group as we did for the earlier data with NA values accounted for. 
We will add our results into the master table earlier where extinction percentages included NA values in the cummulative sum.
```{r}
birds_sum_noNa <- count_sum(birds_noNa)
mam_sum_noNa <- count_sum(mammals_noNa)
vert_sum_noNa <- count_sum(vertebrate_noNa)
other_sum_noNa <- count_sum(all_others_noNa)

all_types_noNa <- rbind(birds_sum_noNa, mam_sum_noNa, vert_sum_noNa, other_sum_noNa)

master_noNA <- all_types_noNa %>%
  left_join(group_total) %>%
  mutate(perc_extinct_noNA = 100*(cum_sum/ sum_species))

master_ex_table <- master_ex_table %>%
  select(extinct_year, group, sum_species, perc_ex_withNA) %>%
  mutate(perc_ex_noNA = master_noNA$perc_extinct_noNA)
  
master_ex_table
```

Lets' visualize the extinction percentages that we calculated excluding extinction records that had NA values for extinction dates.
```{r}
master_ex_table %>% ggplot(aes(x = factor(extinct_year), group = group, color = group)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = perc_ex_withNA), lwd = 1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = perc_ex_noNA), linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Vertebrate Species as EX or EW by the IUCN 2019",
       y = 'Cumulative extinctions as % of UCN-evaluated species',
       x = "Time interval") + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("1500-1600", "1600-1700", "1700-1800", "1800-1900", "1900-2000")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,2, by=0.2)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10))
    
```

The graph above shows the highest and lowest possible extinction percentages for all veterbrates. The solid lines represent the highest values which were generated by including NAs in our initial year bin. The dashed lines represent the lowest values which were generated by excluding species with NAs as extinction dates.
We think that the real percentages of vertebrates extinction are somewhere in between these two lines for each group of species. 
To come up with a line that is in between the highest and lowest lines, we will interpolate the percentages for each bin by projecting the same proportions of species in each bin in our previous lowest possible data (without NA values). Then, we will add the counts derived from the projected proportions of NAs to the lowest possible species count, then find the cumulative percentages by dividing by the common denominator we have been using, total species evaluated.

First, we start with finding the total number of extinctions of NA dates by subtracting the number of rows in our lowest, no NA dates table from the highest, with NA dates table. 
```{r}
na_total <- nrow(all_species_with_year) - nrow(all_species_noNA)
na_total
```

We see that the total number of extinctions that did not have an extinction date is about 47% of all extinct species. 
If we were to leave the species with NA dates out of our final conclusion, that would tell an unaccurate story of the verterbrates extinction overall.
Here we derive a count for each group of NA dates by projecting the same proportions of species per bin in our lowest possible extinction data. 
```{r}
#first, we grab the proportions of extinctions in each bin for the data that has no NAs
#note, the dataframe is already alphabetically sorted by group names
proportions <- master_noNA$count/nrow(all_species_noNA)

#next, we take those proportions multiply it by the total number of NAs for each bin year 
NAcount <- na_total*proportions

#now add those NA counts per bin + the count for data with no NAs together into the dataframe
all_types_NA <- master_noNA %>%
  select(extinct_year, count, group) %>%
  mutate(NA_derived_count = NAcount,
        uncertain_count = NA_derived_count + count)

#lets write a function to calculate cumulative sum for the uncertain counts per species group 
count_cumsum_NA <- function(table) {
  table %>%
  plyr::mutate(cumsum_lowNA = cumsum(uncertain_count)) 
}

birds_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Birds"))
mammals_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Mammals"))
vert_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Vertebrates"))
other_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Other Vertebrates"))

#lets bind them back into the dataframe
bind_NAs <- rbind(birds_NA, mammals_NA, vert_NA, other_NA)
bind_NAs
```

We then add this derived-NA species count to our lowest possible count(without NAs), and divide by the total of all evaluated species to find the cumulative percentages of the line in between the maximum and minimum vertebrates extinction. 

```{r method 2}
#first, we grab the proportions of extinctions in each bin for the data that has no NAs
#note, the dataframe is already alphabetically sorted by group names
proportions <- master_noNA$count/nrow(all_species_noNA)

#next, we take those proportions multiply it by the total number of NAs for each bin year 
NAcount <- na_total*proportions

#now add those NA counts per bin + the count for data with no NAs together into the dataframe
all_types_NA <- master_noNA %>%
  select(extinct_year, count, group) %>%
  mutate(NA_derived_count = NAcount)

#lets write a function to calculate cumulative sum for the uncertain counts per species group 
count_cumsum_NA <- function(table) {
  table %>%
  plyr::mutate(cumsum_lowNA = cumsum(NA_derived_count)) 
}

birds_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Birds"))
mammals_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Mammals"))
vert_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Vertebrates"))
other_NA <- count_cumsum_NA(all_types_NA %>% filter(group == "Other Vertebrates"))

#lets bind them back into the dataframe
bind_NAs <- rbind(birds_NA, mammals_NA, vert_NA, other_NA)
bind_NAs



master_ex_table <- master_ex_table %>%
  left_join(bind_NAs) %>%
  mutate(perc_ex_uncertain = (100*(cumsum_lowNA/sum_species)+ perc_ex_noNA)) %>%
  select(extinct_year, group, sum_species, perc_ex_withNA, perc_ex_noNA, perc_ex_uncertain)
master_ex_table



```
```

```{r method 1}
master_ex_table <- master_ex_table %>%
  left_join(all_types_NA) %>%
  mutate(perc_ex_uncertain = 100*(uncertain_count/sum_species)) %>%
  select(extinct_year, group, sum_species, perc_ex_withNA, perc_ex_noNA, perc_ex_uncertain)
master_ex_table
```

Lets' put these results on multiple graphs to observe the differences, we have delved deeper into the data and explored different permutations of dealing with NA values. The graph below has a similar order of species groups as Cebellos, from high to low: Mammals, Birds, Vertebrates and Other vertebrates.
```{r}
master_ex_table %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = extinct_year, color = group)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = perc_ex_withNA), linetype = "dotdash", lwd=1, alpha =0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = perc_ex_noNA), linetype = "longdash", lwd =1, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = perc_ex_uncertain), linetype = "solid", lwd = 1.5, alpha=0.7) +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Vertebrate Species as EX or EW by the IUCN 2019",
       y = 'Cumulative extinctions as % of UCN-evaluated species',
       x = "Time interval") + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("1500-1600", "1600-1700", "1700-1800", "1800-1900", "1900-2000")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,2, by=0.2)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10))
```

Perhaps the dashed lines above are hard to decipher. The dotted dash lines represent the highest possible extinction rates and the long dash lines represent the lowest, the solid lines are our interpolated uncertainty lines where NA data is projected to have the same proportions as the data without NAs(the lowest possible rates) plus the data wihout NAs itself.
Lets' look individual species group and their different extinction rates.
```{r}
plot1 <- plotting_func(master_ex_table %>% filter(group == "Birds"), "Birds")
plot2 <- plotting_func(master_ex_table %>% filter(group == "Mammals"), "Mammals")
plot3 <- plotting_func(master_ex_table %>% filter(group == "Vertebrates"), "Vertebrates")
plot4 <- plotting_func(master_ex_table %>% filter(group == "Other Vertebrates"), "Other Vertebrates")


grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, ncol = 2)
```

The uncertainly line for birds is unusally lower at 2000 than the lowest possible extinction line. Due to time constraint, we have not been able to discover why this is such. However, the discuss on dealing with NAs is one to be continued throughout all of our future research.
In all, we can agree that the modern rates of vertebrate extinction are much higher than the background rate mentioned in Ceballos's paper at 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (2E/MSY). Instead of using the extinction categories: "EX" = "extinction" category and "EW" = "extinction in the wild" and "PE" = "possibly extinct" to estimate a reasonable conservative extinction rates, we looked at the different ways NA values can affect the final findings. We decided to look the highest and lowest possible extinction rates by including and excluding NAs. We ventured into interpolating an uncertainty line between the two using the excluded NA data proportions for each group of vertebrates. We find that there is no best answer to the exact rates of extinction but rather, we can confirm Ceballos's statement that the current extinction rate is much higher than the background rate. 


```{r}
all_species_noNA <- all_species %>%
  mutate(extinct_year = all_year_noNA) %>%
  drop_na()
all_species_noNA
```
